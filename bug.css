The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results due to incorrect operator precedence or unit mixing. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5em)` might not behave as intended, as the order of operations isn't always intuitive.  Another issue lies in the strict unit requirement. You can't mix units within a single calculation without explicit conversions.
